Context-Free Grammar (CFG) is like a set of rules or instructions used to describe patterns or structures in language, whether it's natural language (like English) or computer languages (like programming syntax).

Imagine a simple recipe book:

1. Each recipe has ingredients and steps.
2. Some ingredients might be simple (like "sugar"), while others are made by combining other ingredients (like "cake batter").

In CFG terms:

- **Rules**: Define how to combine ingredients to make dishes.
- **Starting Point**: Begin with the main dish (like "Dinner").
- **Non-terminals**: Placeholders (like "Main Course" or "Dessert") that break down into smaller components.
- **Terminals**: Final ingredients (like "flour" or "eggs") you can’t break down further.

For example, to describe a burger, you could write:

- Start with "Burger."
- A "Burger" is made of "Bun," "Patty," and "Toppings."
- "Toppings" can be "Cheese," "Lettuce," or "Tomato."

CFG helps computers understand and work with languages by breaking complex structures into manageable rules. It's widely used in compilers, parsers, and even linguistics.

Let’s create a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** to represent **commands** in the Minishell project, such as how a shell processes user inputs.

### Grammar Rules for Minishell Commands

1. **Command → Program Arguments**  
    A command consists of a program name followed by optional arguments.
    
2. **Arguments → Argument Arguments | ε**  
    Arguments can consist of one argument followed by more arguments, or it can be empty (ε).
    
3. **Argument → Word**  
    An argument is a word.
    
4. **Word → "ls" | "cat" | "echo" | "file.txt" | "hello" | "world"**  
    Words can represent specific commands, file names, or text.

### Example: Parsing the Command `echo hello world`

1. Start with **Command**:  
    **Command → Program Arguments**
    
2. Substitute **Program**:  
    **Program → "echo"**
    
3. Substitute **Arguments**:  
    **Arguments → Argument Arguments**
    
4. First **Argument**:  
    **Argument → "hello"**  
    **Arguments → Argument Arguments**
    
5. Second **Argument**:  
    **Argument → "world"**  
    **Arguments → ε** (no more arguments)
    

---

The full parse is:  
**Command → "echo" Arguments**  
**Arguments → "hello" Arguments → "world" Arguments → ε**

This CFG defines how Minishell interprets commands as a combination of a program and its arguments. The same structure can extend to include pipes (`|`), redirections (`>`), or even environment variables like `$HOME`.
